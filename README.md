## Description
1. The work focuses on processing multi-modal analytical documents by extracting text, images, and data tables to maximize data representation and information extraction, utilizing formats like Python code, Markdown, and Mermaid script for compatibility with GPT-4 models.
1. Text is programmatically extracted from documents, processed to improve structure and tag extraction for better searchability, and numerical data is captured through generated Python code for later use.
1. Images and data tables are processed to generate multiple text-based representations (including detailed text descriptions, Mermaid, and Python code for images, and various formats for tables) to ensure information is searchable and usable for calculations, forecasts, and applying machine learning models using Code Interpreter capabilities.

<br/>
<br />

## Current Challenges
1. As of today with conventional techniques, to be able to search through a knowledge base with RAG, text from documents need to be extracted, chunked and stored in a vector database
1. This process now is purely concerned with text: 
    * If the documents have any images, graphs or tables, these elements are usually either ignored or extracted as messy unstructured text
    * Retrieving unstructured table data through RAG will lead to very low accuracy answers
1. LLMs are usually very bad with numbers. If the query requires any sort of calculations, LLMs usually hallucinate or make basic math mistakes


<br/>

## Why do we need this solution?

1. Ingest and interact with multi-modal analytics documents with lots of graphs, numbers and tables
1. Extract structured information from some elements in documents which wasnâ€™t possible before:
    * Images
    * Graphs
    * Tables
1. Use the Code Interpreter to formulate answers where calculations are needed based on search results 


<br/>


## Examples of Industry Applications

1. Analyze Investment opportunity documents for Private Equity deals
1. Analyze tables from tax documents for audit purposes
1. Analyze financial statements and perform initial computations
1. Analyze and interact with multi-modal Manufacturing documents 
1. Process academic and research papers
1. Ingest and interact with textbooks, manuals and guides
1. Analyze traffic and city planning documents

# The Concept of Processing Pipelines and Processors

For the sake of providing an extendable modular architecture, we have implemented in this accelerator the concept of a processing pipeline, where each document undergoes a pre-specified number of processing steps, each step adding some degree of change to the documents. Processors are format-specific (e.g. PDF, MS Word, Excel, etc..), and are created to ingest multimodal documents in the most efficient way for that format. Therefore the list of processing steps for a PDF is different than the list of steps for an Excel sheet. This is implemented in the `processor.py` Python file. The list of processing steps can be customized by changing the file `processing_plan.json`. As an example, processing Excel files will follow the below steps, each step building on the results of the previous one:
1. `extract_xlsx_using_openpyxl`: read the Excel sheet with OpenPyxl and store it in a dataframe.
1. `create_table_doc_chunks_markdown`: go through the dataframe after converting it to Markdown, and chunk into text in a smart way: chunks that are almost equal in size but without breaking any sentences in the middle.
1. `create_image_doc_chunk`s: extract images from the Excel if any
1. `generate_tags_for_all_chunks`: for each chunk of text, generate tags. This is very important for hybrid search in AI Search.
1. `generate_document_wide_tags`: genereate tags for the whole documents. This is very important for hybrid search in AI Search.
1. `generate_document_wide_summary`: provide a document summary that will be inserted into the Context for RAG, as well as the top chunks.
1. `generate_analysis_for_text`: provide an analysis for each chunk of text in relation to the whole document, e.g. what does chunk add as information vs the whole text.

At the start of the processing pipeline, a Python dictionary variable called `ingestion_pipeline_dict` with all the input parameters is created in the constructor of the Processor and then passed to the first step. The step will do its own processing, will change variables inside the `ingestion_pipeline_dict` and will add new ones. The `ingestion_pipeline_dict` is then returned by this first step, and will then become the input for the second step. This way, the `ingestion_pipeline_dict` is passed from each step to the next downstream the pipeline. It is the common context which all steps work on. The `ingestion_pipeline_dict` is saved in a text file at the end of each step, so as to provide a way for debugging and troubleshooting under the processing folder name in the `stages` directory.

This is a visual representation of a pipeline:

At the end of this document, there is a [list](#processing-steps) of all the steps and a short explanation for each one of them. The below JSON block describes the processing pipelines per document format per processing option:

<br/>
<br/>


### Local Development for Azure Cloud

For rapid development iterations and for testing on the cloud, the `push.ps1` script can be used to build only the docker images and push them to the Azure Container Registry, without creating or changing any other component in the resource group or in the architecture. The docker images will have then to be **manually** assigned to the web app, by going to the web app page in the Azure Portal, and then navigate to `Deployment > Deployment Center` on the left-hand side, and then go to `Settings` on the right-hand side, then to the `Tag` dropdown and choose the correct docker image. 

Please edit the `push.ps1` script, and fill in the right values for the Azure Container Registry endpoint, username and password, for the Resource Group name, and Subscription ID. Then, to run the script, follow the below instrcutions in a `Powershell`. It is important that Docker Desktop version is installed and running at that point locally. The command has to be run from the root directory of the project: 

```bash
# cd into the root folder of the project
cd <project root>

# run the docker images update script
deployment/push.ps1
```
 
<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="images/pushacr.png" width="800" />
</p>
<br/>
