Sure, here's a summary of the key aspects of your repository:

## Main Features

1. **Document Ingestion**: The application supports ingestion of various file formats including PDFs, MS Word documents, MS Excel sheets, and CSV files. This is handled by the [`ingest_doc.py`](code/ingest_doc.py) file.

2. **Text, Images, and Tables Extraction**: After ingestion, the application extracts text, images, and tables from the documents. This is done in the [`doc_utils.py`](code/doc_utils.py) file, specifically in the [`is_file_or_url`](code/doc_utils.py) function.

3. **Tag Generation**: The application generates tags for searchability. This is also handled in the [`doc_utils.py`](code/doc_utils.py) file.

4. **Data Storage**: The extracted data is stored in a vector database for later retrieval. This is likely handled in the [`processor.py`](code/processor.py) file.

5. **User Query Handling**: The application handles user queries and searches the database for relevant responses. This is likely handled in the [`react_search.py`](code/react_search.py) file.
