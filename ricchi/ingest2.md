The document ingestion process in your workspace involves the following steps:

1. **Ingest Document**: The application begins by ingesting the document. This could be a local file or a URL, as determined by the [`is_file_or_url`](code/doc_utils.py) function in [`code/doc_utils.py`](code/doc_utils.py). This is handled by the [`ingest_doc_using_processors`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fricchi%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2Fmultimodal-rag-code-execution%2Fcode%2Fprocessor.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A309%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "code/processor.py") function in [`code/processor.py`](code/processor.py), which selects the appropriate processor based on the document's file extension.

2. **Extract Text, Images, and Tables**: The selected processor then extracts the relevant data from the document. For PDFs, this is handled by the [`PdfProcessor`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fricchi%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2Fmultimodal-rag-code-execution%2Fcode%2Fprocessor.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A248%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "code/processor.py") class in [`code/processor.py`](code/processor.py), which uses functions like `create_pdf_chunks`, `delete_pdf_chunks`, `pdf_extract_high_res_chunk_images`, and `pdf_extract_images` from [`code/doc_utils.py`](code/doc_utils.py).

3. **Generate Tags for Searchability**: After extraction, the data is processed to generate tags that enhance searchability. This is part of the [`execute_processing_plan`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fricchi%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2Fmultimodal-rag-code-execution%2Fcode%2Fprocessor.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A189%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "code/processor.py") method in the `Processor` class in [`code/processor.py`](code/processor.py).

4. **Store Data in Vector Database**: The processed data is then committed to a vector store for later retrieval. This is handled by the [`commit_assets_to_vector_store`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fricchi%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2Fmultimodal-rag-code-execution%2Fcode%2Fprocessor.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "code/processor.py") method in the `Processor` class in [`code/processor.py`](code/processor.py).

5. **User Query**: The user can then query the processed data.

6. **Search Database**: The application searches the vector database for matches to the user's query.

7. **Generate Response**: The application generates a response based on the search results.

These steps are also visually represented in the [`ricchi/ingest.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fricchi%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2Fmultimodal-rag-code-execution%2Fricchi%2Fingest.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\ricchi\OneDrive - Microsoft\Desktop\multimodal-rag-code-execution\ricchi\ingest.md") file and in the [`README.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fricchi%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2Fmultimodal-rag-code-execution%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\ricchi\OneDrive - Microsoft\Desktop\multimodal-rag-code-execution\README.md") file in your workspace.
