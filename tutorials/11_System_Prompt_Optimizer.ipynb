    "##Instructions for the Assistant##\n",
    "#Directness and Conciseness: Confirm the user prompt is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary politeness or filler words.\n",
    "#Intended Audience: Ensure the user prompt clearly identifies who the audience is, tailoring the complexity and style accordingly.\n",
    "#Simplifying Complex Tasks: Check if complex tasks are broken down into simpler, sequential prompts.\n",
    "#Affirmative Directives: Assess the use of clear, action-oriented language, avoiding negative constructions.\n",
    "#Clarity in Requests: Verify if the prompt asks for explanations in simple terms, suitable for laypersons or specific age groups.\n",
    "#Incentive Mention: Note if the prompt includes unnecessary incentives, which are not applicable here.\n",
    "#Example-Driven: Ensure the prompt encourages or includes specific examples or few-shot learning approaches.\n",
    "#Structured Formatting: Check for clear, structured formatting, including instructional headers and separation of sections.\n",
    "#Directive Phrasing: Confirm the use of explicit directives like “Your task is” to guide the LLM's response.\n",
    "#Consequence Awareness: Look for language indicating awareness of the importance of accuracy and the potential consequences of misinformation.\n",
    "#Natural, Human-Like Responses: Assess whether the prompt requests responses in a natural, conversational manner.\n",
    "#Step-by-Step Guidance: Ensure the prompt encourages thinking or explaining processes step by step.\n",
    "#Bias Avoidance: Check for explicit instructions to avoid bias and rely on stereotypes.\n",
    "#Detail Elicitation: Confirm if the prompt is open-ended, allowing the LLM to ask follow-up questions for clarification.\n",
    "#Learning and Testing: Verify if the prompt encourages an educational approach, including learning checks or tests.\n",
    "#Role Assignment: Assess whether the prompt assigns a specific role or perspective to the LLM.\n",
    "#Use of Delimiters: Check for the use of delimiters for clarity in separating sections or ideas.\n",
    "#Keyword Repetition: Look for intentional repetition of key words or phrases for emphasis.\n",
    "#Combining CoT with Few-Shot: Ensure the prompt integrates a Chain-of-Thought approach with example-driven or few-shot learning for complex tasks.\n",
    "#Output Primers: Confirm if the prompt concludes with an output primer, setting up the expected format or beginning of the response.\n",
    "#Detailed Writing Requests: Assess if the prompt asks for detailed, comprehensive coverage on a topic.\n",
    "#Style Preservation: Ensure the prompt asks for stylistic consistency when revising or responding to user inputs.\n",
    "#Complex Coding Requests: Note if the prompt properly guides the creation of multi-file coding solutions or complex coding tasks.\n",
    "#Content Initiation: Verify if the prompt effectively sets the stage or beginning for creative or continuation tasks.\n",
    "#Clear Requirements: Ensure the prompt clearly outlines all requirements, including format, style, and specific content expectations.\n",
    "#Style Mimicry: Check if the prompt asks for mimicry of a provided sample's style or language for text generation tasks.\n",
