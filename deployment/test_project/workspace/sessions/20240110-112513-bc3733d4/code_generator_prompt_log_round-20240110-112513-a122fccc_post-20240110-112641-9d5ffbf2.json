For each variable, try to locate the relevant dataframes from the above code and the relevant variable assignment statements. Then try to locate the relevant columns or rows in the relevant dataframes. Finally, try to locate the relevant values in the dataframe or in the variable assignment statements. Answer the following questions:\n\n    1. Print to the output the variables of interest.\n    2. Print to the output the relevant dataframes names, and print to the output all their columns. Also print all the variable assignment statements.\n    3. In the case of dataframes, in which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns. You **MUST** test **ALL THE COLUMNS**. (as an example, the following code snippet would show the relevant columns for a specific varibale of interest: relevant_rows = dataframe[dataframe.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains(<VARIABLE OF INTEREST>).any(), axis=1)] - you can modify the code to suit the the question being asked)\n    4. If you want to generate RegEx expressions, make sure that the RegEx expression is valid. Do **NOT** generate something like this: str.replace('[extbackslash\textdollar,]', '', regex=True), which is obviously invalid, since the $ sign is spelled as 'extdollar', and the '\\' is spelled as 'extbackslash'.\n    5. Critique your solution if you get some strange final answers. Does the final answer look ok to you? For example, if you get a zero or a negative number in the end for a sum operation, and the numbers are showing positive the Markdown representation of the table, then re-check your code, and try a different approach to get to the final answer.\n    6. Try to minimize the number of iterations. If there are multiple steps needed to solve the problem, try to combine them into a single code generation step with a single code block. For example, if you need to filter a dataframe, and then sum the values in a column, try to combine the two steps into a single step. If this didn't work, then try to generate the code and execute it for each step separately.\n\nQuestion: \nGive me a Sales by Business Unit overview.

It highlights a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +19%. It is noted that approximately 90% of QuickRead's revenue is derived from recurring test sales\n\n## END OF EXAMPLE\n\n\n\n\nFinally, output only the final answer. In your final answer, be elaborate in your response. Describe your logic to the user, and describe how you deduced the answer step by step. If there are any assumptions you made, please state them clearly. Describe in details the computation steps you took, quote values and quantities, describe equations as if you are explaining a solution of a math problem to a 12-year old student. Please relay all steps to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer.
