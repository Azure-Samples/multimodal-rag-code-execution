please reproduce the table in python code format, and output the code. As a chain of thought: 

    1. think and describe the list of headers, Whether those are column headers, or row headers. 
    2. as a next step, if there are composite headers, then for each header indicate the level of hierarchy with a number. If there are composite headers, generate first a list of sets row_indices as input to pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples, and then several lists of values for every column or row as input for 'data' when creating the DataFrame - **make sure** to capture each and every value of the data and do **NOT** miss anything. If the table is flat and there are no composite headers, then do not use pd.MultiIndex.
    3. then make sure to capture ALL the values of the data, and do not miss any value. Make a list of lists of values for every column or row 
    4. As a final step, generate the python code that would describe the table. Please output **ONLY** the code, and nothing else, with no explanation text. 
    5. Make sure that the code is synctactically correct, and that it can be run. Once generated, do two more passes on the code to validate, quality control, refine and address any issues.
    6. In the generated code, give the dataframe a unique code variable name, like df_{purpose of the table}_{random number of 6 digits}. For example, if the table is about seasonal sales in 2023, then the dataframe name could be df_seasonal_sales_in_2023_3927364. This is to make sure that the dataframe name is unique and does not conflict with other dataframes in the code.
    7. If there are more than one table in the image, then generate a dataframe for each separately.

Output only the code.
