code_harvesting_from_text = """
Please do the following as a chain of thought:

    1. Please check and read the TEXT EXTRACT below in full.
    2. You **MUST** locate all numerical data in the TEXT EXTRACT, and then you **MUST** make a list of these numerical quantities. For example, make a list of all numbers, percentages, rates, ratios, and any other numerical data the TEXT EXTRACT.
    3. Using the above list generated in Step 2, please generate Python code to capture the numerical data quantities in the list. The generated code should capture all variables of interest in the TEXT EXTRACT. The generated code should declare variables to capture those numerical quantities. 
    4. In the generated code, give the variable meaningful and unique names, like var_[purpose of the variable]_[Random Block ID]. For example, if the variable is about seasonal sales in 2023, then the variable name could be var_seasonal_sales_in_2023_39275336. This is to make sure that the variable name is unique and does not conflict with other variables in the code. If the variable is a currency, include which currency this is in the name.
    5.  At the start of the Python codeblock, generate an elaborate summary of the whole TEXT EXTRACT as a Python comment, and then add to this summary the purpose of each variable which makes it easy for the reader to understand how to use those variables. Do **NOT** mention that this is a summary of the TEXT EXTRACT. 
    6. Try to give as much information as possible in the Python comments. For example, if a variable is about the sales of a product, then the comment should include the name of the product, the year of sales, the region of sales, the type of sales, etc. If the variable is about a percentage, then the comment should include the name of the percentage, the year of the percentage, the region of the percentage, the type of percentage, etc. If the variable represents a currency, you **MUST** include the currency in the variable name and in the comment.
    7. At the start and end of the generated code block, generate start and closing comments that can identify this code block. Generate the following: "START OF CODE BLOCK [Random Block ID]" at the start, and "END OF CODE BLOCK [Random Block ID]" at the end. This is to make sure that the code block is unique and does not conflict with other code blocks.
    8. For all the variables located in the list from Step 2 above, please output a Markdown table in a Markdown codeblock
    9. The generated code should be able to run without any errors. It should be syntactically correct.


**TEXT EXTRACT:**
## START OF TEXT EXTRACT
{text}
## END OF TEXT EXTRACT

Random Block ID: {random_block_id}


**Output:**
Output only the generated code and the Markdown table in a Markdown codeblock. Do not output any other text or explanation. The generated code should be full of elaborate and detailed comments explaining the purpose, use, and context of each variable. For each variable, think of how another Python program might use the generated code as an imported package, and whether enough information has been provided so that these variables can be located and used. Use the above Random Block ID to identify the variables and the code block, so that there's no clash in scope between the generated variables of the different code blocks.

image_description_prompt = """
Please describe the attached image in full details, with a description of each object in the image. If the attached is a screenshot of a document page with multiple images in it, then you **MUST* repeat the below steps per image. 
Try to answer the following questions:

    1. What information does this image convey? 
    2. Given the below text context (Previous Page, Current Page, Next Page), how does this image add to the information?
    3. If this image is a natural image (people, scenery, city landscape, offices, etc..), describe all the objects in that image, and describe the background and setting of the image. 
    4. If this image is an organization chart, a flowchart, a process chart, or any chart that conveys relationships and progress in timeline or execution, please generate the text description of this chart as accurately as possible, as well as generate the Mermaid code to capture the full information in the chart. As an accurate and faithful assistant, you **MUST** be able to capture all the information in the chart. When generating Mermaid code, do not generate paranthesis in the node names inside the code, because it might throw an error. 
    5. If this image is an image of a numerical chart, like a line chart or a bar chart or a pie chart, generate a Markdown table that accurately represents the quantities being displayed. Describe in text the axes labels, the trend lines, the exact amounts, and so on and so forth. Be very descriptive when it comes to the numerical quantities: e.g. "the sales in May 2022 was $4.2 million", or "the market share of the X product is 22%", etc.. If this is a line chart, make sure that the values in the chart are aligned with the labels on the axes (X and Y are correct vs axes). You **MUST** output a Markdown representation of the data in a Markdown codeblock delimited by '```markdown' and '```'. The numbers **must absolutely** be accurate. Also you **MUST** output the Python code that enables the creation of the Pandas Dataframe of the data in the chart, but do not compute the data. After extracing the data, double check your results to make sure that the Markdown table and Python code are accurate and representative of the data in the image. In the generated code, give the dataframe a unique code variable name, like df_{purpose of the table}_{random number of 6 digits}. For example, if the table is about seasonal sales in 2023, then the dataframe name could be df_seasonal_sales_in_2023_3927364. This is to make sure that the dataframe name is unique and does not conflict with other dataframes in the code.
    6. For all other cases, describe what's in the image as elaborately and as detailed as possible. 
    7. If the image is that of a table, try to describe the table in full details, with a description of each column and row in the table. For each column, describe the header name, the data type and the purpose of the data and the column. If the table is a numerical table, try to describe the purpose and the trends of the different columns and rows in that table. In addition to that, output the table in Markdown format to be able to represent it in text. If the table is not clearly labeled, give the table a unique Title, based on the context supplied and the purpose of the table. If there are more than one table in the image, then describe each table separately. Please output the Markdown in a Markdown codeblock delimited by '```markdown' and '```'.

If the table is flat and there are no composite headers, then do not use pd.MultiIndex.
    3. then make sure to capture ALL the values of the data, and do not miss any value. Make a list of lists of values for every column or row 
    4. As a final step, generate the python code that would describe the table. Please output **ONLY** the code, and nothing else, with no explanation text. 
    5. Make sure that the code is synctactically correct, and that it can be run. Once generated, do two more passes on the code to validate, quality control, refine and address any issues.
    6. In the generated code, give the dataframe a unique code variable name, like df_{purpose of the table}_{random number of 6 digits}. For example, if the table is about seasonal sales in 2023, then the dataframe name could be df_seasonal_sales_in_2023_3927364. This is to make sure that the dataframe name is unique and does not conflict with other dataframes in the code.

For example, if you need to filter a dataframe, and then sum the values in a column, try to combine the two steps into a single step.

Include the variable assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant variables **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.
    3. Use the Codeblocks delimited by '## START OF CODEBLOCK' and '## END OF CODEBLOCK' to identify and print to the output the relevant dataframes names, and print to the output all their columns. Also print all the variable assignment statements. Include the dataframes assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant dataframes **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.
    4. In the case of dataframes, in which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns. You **MUST** test **ALL THE COLUMNS**. (as an example, the following code snippet would show the relevant columns for a specific varibale of interest: relevant_rows = dataframe[dataframe.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains(<VARIABLE OF INTEREST>).any(), axis=1)] - you can modify the code to suit the the question being asked). Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.
    5. If you want to generate RegEx expressions, make sure that the RegEx expression is valid. Do **NOT** generate something like this: str.replace('[extbackslash	extdollar,]', '', regex=True), which is obviously invalid, since the $ sign is spelled as 'extdollar', and the '\\' is spelled as 'extbackslash'.
    6. If you have trouble accessing the previously defined variables or the dataframes for any reasons, then use the Python Codeblocks delimited by '## START OF CODEBLOCK' and '## END OF CODEBLOCK' to extract the information you need, and then generate the needed Python code.
    7. Generate the answer to the query. You **MUST** clarify AND print to the output **ALL** calculation steps leading up to the final answer.
    8. You **MUST** detail how you came up with the answer. Please provide a complete description of the calculation steps taken to get to the answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. "This answer was derived from document 'Sales_Presentation.pdf', page 34".
    9. If the answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.
    10. **VERY IMPORTANT**: do **NOT** attempt to create a list of variables or dataframes directly. Instead, you should access the data from the variables and dataframes that were defined in the Python file that was run.

Then try to locate the relevant columns or rows in the dataframe. Finally, try to locate the relevant values in the dataframe. Answer the following questions:

    1. Print to the output the variables of interest.
    2. Print to the output the relevant dataframes names, and print to the output all their columns.

Question: 
{query}

Generate the additional code to run to answer the above question. Do not re-generate the code included above, just generate the additional code to run to answer the question. Make sure to print the final answer to the stdout output. Since the python exec function is used, you **MUST** also package the code in a function called foo() and return the final answer, e.g. "def foo(): return sales_projection". Do **NOT** call foo() at the end of the code. Generate ready-to-execute code **ONLY**, do not output any text or other explanations. All variable names in the code should be correct and relevant. Do **NOT** generate generic variable names, and do **NOT** take assumptions. All variables in the code should be either declared or referenced in the code. Do **NOT** generate code that references variables that are not declared or referenced in the code.

From the above Text, please perform the following tasks:
    1. You **MUST** extract the important and meaningful keywords to make a comprehensive list. Extract them verbatim, word-for-word, and add a few words as context around the keywords so as to make them ultra-descriptive. They keywords are about topical content only. Do **NOT** extract keywords about form, style or text structure like 'bullet points for ease of understanding', 'dates inclusion', 'embedded Python code exclusion', 'redundancies removal' or 'optimized keyword and tag list'.
    2. You **MUST** also extract the very important and ultra-descriptive tags, and add the tags to the comprehensive list of keywords. These combined keywords and tags will be used to generate embeddings and then used for search purposes. You **MUST** be exhaustive and comprehensive in generating the tags. Do NOT LEAVE OUT any details in the text, and do NOT generate tags that are not in the text.
    3. Be **VERY** details-oriented, **make sure** you capture ALL the details of the text in the form of keywords or tags. Do **NOT** make up or generate keywords or tags that are not in the text.
    4. The keywords and the tags needs to be ultra-descriptive, elaborate and detailed. Each keyword or tag needs to capture and relay all the relationships and connections in the text. For example, when the text says "the actual and estimated revenues of company X", then the ideal tags would be "actual revenues of company X" and "estimated revenues of company X". For this example and instance, do **NOT** generate tags such as "actual", "estimated" and "revenues" which do not capture the full relationships and connections of the tag.
    5. Each keyword or tag needs to have enough information so that the user would understand it without knowing the original text or the context.
    6. You **MUST** ignore any embedded Python code. 
    7. You **MUST NOT** generate tags that include example-specific information from any few-shot examples included in the text. These are usually delimited by ### START OF EXAMPLE and ### END OF EXAMPLE, or some similar delimiters.
    8. If the text include entity names, dates, numbers or money amounts, you **MUST** include them in the list of tags. 
    9. Finally, after combining the lists of keywords and tags combined in a comma-separated format, you **MUST** refactor the combined list to make sure that there are no redundancies, and to remove the lower-accuracy keywords and tags, and to reduce the number of elements in the list so that the list is optimized. 

Do **NOT** generate any other text other than the comma-separated keyword and tag list.
