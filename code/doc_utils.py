code_harvesting_from_text = """You are a helpful AI assistant that helps developers to generate code snippets from text. You have been given a text that contains text. You need to generatecode snippets from the text.

Please do the following as a chain of thought:

    1. Please check and read the TEXT EXTRACT below in full.
    2. You **MUST** locate all numerical data in the TEXT EXTRACT, and then you **MUST** make a list of these numerical quantities. For example, make a list of all numbers, percentages, rates, ratios, and any other numerical data the TEXT EXTRACT.
    3. Using the above list generated in Step 2, please generate Python code to capture the numerical data quantities in the list. The generated code should capture all variables of interest in the TEXT EXTRACT. The generated code should declare variables to capture those numerical quantities. 
    4. In the generated code, give the variable meaningful and unique names, like var_[purpose of the variable]_[Random Block ID]. For example, if the variable is about seasonal sales in 2023, then the variable name could be var_seasonal_sales_in_2023_39275336. This is to make sure that the variable name is unique and does not conflict with other variables in the code. If the variable is a currency, include which currency this is in the name.
    5.  At the start of the Python codeblock, generate an elaborate summary of the whole TEXT EXTRACT as a Python comment, and then add to this summary the purpose of each variable which makes it easy for the reader to understand how to use those variables. Do **NOT** mention that this is a summary of the TEXT EXTRACT. 
    6. Try to give as much information as possible in the Python comments. For example, if a variable is about the sales of a product, then the comment should include the name of the product, the year of sales, the region of sales, the type of sales, etc. If the variable is about a percentage, then the comment should include the name of the percentage, the year of the percentage, the region of the percentage, the type of percentage, etc. If the variable represents a currency, you **MUST** include the currency in the variable name and in the comment.
    7. At the start and end of the generated code block, generate start and closing comments that can identify this code block. Generate the following: "START OF CODE BLOCK [Random Block ID]" at the start, and "END OF CODE BLOCK [Random Block ID]" at the end. This is to make sure that the code block is unique and does not conflict with other code blocks.
    8. For all the variables located in the list from Step 2 above, please output a Markdown table in a Markdown codeblock
    9. The generated code should be able to run without any errors. It should be syntactically correct.


**TEXT EXTRACT:**
## START OF TEXT EXTRACT
{text}
## END OF TEXT EXTRACT

Random Block ID: {random_block_id}


**Output:**
Output only the generated code and the Markdown table in a Markdown codeblock. Do not output any other text or explanation. The generated code should be full of elaborate and detailed comments explaining the purpose, use, and context of each variable. For each variable, think of how another Python program might use the generated code as an imported package, and whether enough information has been provided so that these variables can be located and used. Use the above Random Block ID to identify the variables and the code block, so that there's no clash in scope between the generated variables of the different code blocks.

markdown_extract_header_and_summarize_prompt = """
You are a Data Engineer resonsible for reforming and preserving the quality of Markdown tables. A table will be passed to you in the form of a Markdown string. You are designed to output JSON. 

Your task is to extract the column names of the header of the table from the Markdown string in the form of a comma-separated list. If the column names do exist, please return them verbatim word-for-word with no change, except fixing format or alignment issues (extra spaces and new lines can be removed). 

If the table does not have a header, then please check the data rows and generate column names for the header that fit the data types of the columns and the nature of the data. 

**VERY IMPORTANT**: If the table has an unnamed index column, typically the leftmost column, you **MUST** generate a column name for it.

Finally, please generate a brief semantic summary of the table in English. This is not about the technical characteristics of the table. The summary should summarize the business purpose and contents of the table. The summary should be to the point with two or three paragraphs.

The Markdown table: 
## START OF MARKDOWN TABLE
{table}
## END OF MARKDOWN TABLE

JSON OUTPUT:
You **MUST** generate the below JSON dictionary as your output. 

{{
    "columns": "list of comma-separated column names. If the table has a header, please return the column names as they are. If the table does not have a header, then generate column names that fit the data types and nature of the data. Do **NOT** forget any unnamed index columns.",

Please describe the attached image in full details, with a description of each object in the image. If the attached is a screenshot of a document chunk with multiple images in it, then you **MUST* repeat the below steps per image. 
Try to answer the following questions:

    1. What information does this image convey? 
    2. Given the below text context (Previous Chunk, Current Chunk, Next Chunk), how does this image add to the information?
    3. If this image is a natural image (people, scenery, city landscape, offices, etc..), describe all the objects in that image, and describe the background and setting of the image. 
    4. If this image is an organization chart, a flowchart, a process chart, or any chart that conveys relationships and progress in timeline or execution, please generate the text description of this chart as accurately as possible, as well as generate the Mermaid code to capture the full information in the chart. As an accurate and faithful assistant, you **MUST** be able to capture all the information in the chart. When generating Mermaid code, do not generate paranthesis in the node names inside the code, because it might throw an error. 
    5. If this image is an image of a numerical chart, like a line chart or a bar chart or a pie chart, generate a Markdown table that accurately represents the quantities being displayed. Describe in text the axes labels, the trend lines, the exact amounts, and so on and so forth. Be very descriptive when it comes to the numerical quantities: e.g. "the sales in May 2022 was $4.2 million", or "the market share of the X product is 22%", etc.. If this is a line chart, make sure that the values in the chart are aligned with the labels on the axes (X and Y are correct vs axes). You **MUST** output a Markdown representation of the data in a Markdown codeblock delimited by '```markdown' and '```'. The numbers **must absolutely** be accurate. Also you **MUST** output the Python code that enables the creation of the Pandas Dataframe of the data in the chart, but do not compute the data. After extracing the data, double check your results to make sure that the Markdown table and Python code are accurate and representative of the data in the image. In the generated code, give the dataframe a unique code variable name, like df_{purpose of the table}_{random number of 6 digits}. For example, if the table is about seasonal sales in 2023, then the dataframe name could be df_seasonal_sales_in_2023_3927364. This is to make sure that the dataframe name is unique and does not conflict with other dataframes in the code.
    6. For all other cases, describe what's in the image as elaborately and as detailed as possible. 
    7. If the image is that of a table, try to describe the table in full details, with a description of each column and row in the table. For each column, describe the header name, the data type and the purpose of the data and the column. If the table is a numerical table, try to describe the purpose and the trends of the different columns and rows in that table. In addition to that, output the table in Markdown format to be able to represent it in text. If the table is not clearly labeled, give the table a unique Title, based on the context supplied and the purpose of the table. If there are more than one table in the image, then describe each table separately. Please output the Markdown in a Markdown codeblock delimited by '```markdown' and '```'.
    8. Try to guess the purpose of why the authors have included this image in the document.
    9. If the attached is a screenshot of a document chunk with multiple images in it, then you **MUST* repeat the above steps per image and generate it all in the same output. 
    10. If any point in the above is not applicable, you do **NOT** have to say "Not applicable" or "Not applicable as this is not ...", you can just skip that point. No need for needless text or explanations to be generated.
    11. **IMPORTANT**: If the image is a screenshot of a document chunk with multiple images in it, then you **MUST* repeat the above steps per image and generate it all in the same output.

As previously highlighted and stressed already, if the attached is a screenshot of a document chunk with multiple images in it, then you **MUST* repeat the above steps per image and generate it all in the same output.

If there are composite headers, generate first a list of sets of hierarchical headers, and then several lists of values for every column or row as input for 'data' when creating the Markdown representation - **make sure** to capture each and every value of the data and do **NOT** miss anything. If the table is flat and there are no composite headers, then do not generate the hierarchical headers.
    3. then make sure to capture ALL the values of the data, and do not miss any value. Make a list of lists of values for every column or row 
    4. As a final step, generate the Markdown output that would describe the table. Please output **ONLY** the Markdown, and nothing else, with no explanation text. 
    5. Make sure that the Markdown table is representative of the table in the image. Once generated, do two more passes on the code to validate, quality control, refine and address any issues.
    6. If there are more than one table in the image, then generate Markdown for each separately.

Output only the Markdown.

Here is the Chain of Thought and the step-by-step that you should follow:

    1. Please analyze the question first, and locate the variables of interests in the question. For each variable, try to locate the relevant dataframes in the Infoblocks above (delimited by '## START OF INFOBLOCK' and '## END OF INFOBLOCK') and the relevant variable assignment statements.
    2. You **MUST** import the list of Python files specified by the user above in the "List of Python Files" section, if the section is available.
    3. Use all the information provided in whatever format in the Infoblocks delimited by '## START OF INFOBLOCK' and '## END OF INFOBLOCK' to identify and print to the output the variables of interest. Include the variable assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant variables **ONLY**. If Python code is included in the Infoblock, then generate the custom Python code that will do this step and execute it.
    4. Use the Infoblocks delimited by '## START OF INFOBLOCK' and '## END OF INFOBLOCK' to identify and print to the output the relevant dataframes names if provided, and print to the output all their columns. Also print all the variable assignment statements. Include the dataframes assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant dataframes **ONLY**. Generate the custom Python code that will do this step and execute it.
    5. If you have trouble accessing the previously defined variables or the dataframes for any reasons, then use the Python Infoblocks delimited by '## START OF INFOBLOCK' and '## END OF INFOBLOCK' to extract the information you need, and then generate the needed Python code.
    6. Generate the answer to the query. You **MUST** clarify AND print to the output **ALL** calculation steps leading up to the final answer.
    7. You **MUST** detail how you came up with the answer. Please provide a complete description of the calculation steps taken to get to the answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the chunk number you got the answer from, e.g. "This answer was derived from document 'Sales_Presentation.pdf', chunk 34".
    8. Generate in **FULL** the answer with all explanations and calculations steps associated with it, and share it with the user in text. **MAKE SURE** to mention the final numbers or quantities in the answer.
    9. If the answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.
    10. **VERY IMPORTANT**: do **NOT** attempt to create a list of variables or dataframes directly. Instead, you should access the data from the variables and dataframes that were defined in the Python file that was run.
    

Question: {query}

In your final answer, be elaborate in your response. Describe your logic and the calculation steps to the user, and describe how you deduced the answer step by step. If there are any assumptions you made, please state them clearly. Describe in details the computation steps you took, quote values and quantities, describe equations as if you are explaining a solution of a math problem to a 12-year old student. Please relay all steps to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the chunk number you got the answer from, e.g. "This answer was derived from document 'Sales_Presentation.pdf', chunk 34". After generating the final response, and if the final answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.

To answer any question, here's the chain of thought:

Please analyze the question first, and locate the variables of interests in the question. For each variable, try to locate the relevant dataframes from the above code. Then try to locate the relevant columns or rows in the dataframe. Finally, try to locate the relevant values in the dataframe. Answer the following questions:

    1. Print to the output the variables of interest.
    2. Print to the output the relevant dataframes names, and print to the output all their columns. 
    3. In which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns. You **MUST** test **ALL THE COLUMNS**. (as an example, the following code snippet would show the relevant columns for a specific varibale of interest: relevant_rows = dataframe[dataframe.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains(<VARIABLE OF INTEREST>).any(), axis=1)] - you can modify the code to suit the the question being asked)

Question: 
{query}

Generate the additional code to run to answer the above question. Do not re-generate the code included above, just generate the additional code to run to answer the question. Make sure to print the final answer to the stdout output. Since the python exec function is used, you **MUST** also package the code in a function called foo() and return the final answer, e.g. "def foo(): return sales_projection". Do **NOT** call foo() at the end of the code. Generate ready-to-execute code **ONLY**, do not output any text or other explanations. All variable names in the code should be correct and relevant. Do **NOT** generate generic variable names, and do **NOT** take assumptions. All variables in the code should be either declared or referenced in the code. Do **NOT** generate code that references variables that are not declared or referenced in the code.

**Query:** 
You **MUST** give the user query below the **utmost** attention and answer it to the best of your ability: 
## START OF QUERY
{query}
## END OF QUERY


**Vision Support:**
In case the user question asks a question which requires vision capabilities, you can refer to the below answer for support, if provided:
{vision_support}


**Computation Support:**
In case the user question asks a question which requires computation, you can refer to the below answer for support, if provided:
{computation_support}


**Final Answer:**
Be elaborate in your response. Describe your logic to the user, and describe how you deduced the answer step by step. If there are any assumptions you made, please state them clearly. If there any computation steps you took, please relay them to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer. If applicable, describe in details the computation steps you took, quote values and quantities, describe equations as if you are explaining a solution of a math problem to a 12-year old student. Please relay all steps to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer. You **MUST** reference the PDF Document(s) and the section number(s) you got the answer from, e.g. "This answer was derived from document 'Sales_Presentation.pdf', section 34 and 36". The reference **MUST** contain the section number as well. If an answer is given in the Computation Support section, then give more weight to this section since it was computed by the Code Interpreter, and use the answer provided in the Computation Support section as a solid basis to your final answer. Do **NOT** mention the search result sections labeled "Search Result: ## START OF SEARCH RESULT" and "## END OF SEARCH RESULT." as references in your final answer. If there are some elements in the final answer that can be tabularized such as a timeseries of data, or a dataset, or a sequence of numbers or a matrix of categories, then you **MUST** format these elements as a Markdown table, in addition to all other explanations described above. 
You **MUST** generate the Final Answer in the same language as as the Query. If the Query is in English, then the Final Answer must be in English. If the Query is in French, then the Final Answer must be in French. 

**Critiquing the Final Answer**:
After generating the Final Answer, please try to answer the below questions. These questions are for the Assistant. 
    1. Think step by step 
    2. Rate your work on a scale of 1-10 for sound logic
    3. Do you think that you are correct?
    4. Is the Final Answer in the same natural language as the Query?

You **MUST** include in the output the most 3 to 5 most relevant reference numbers. Do not generate the document names or document paths, as these will be identified by the reference number in the "search_result_number" field. The correct reference format in the Final Answer is to include the search result number in brackets, e.g. [6], or [3]. 


**JSON Output**:

The JSON dictionary output should include the Final Answer and the References. The references is an array of dictionaries. Each Reference includes in it the path to the asset file, the path to the document file, the name of the document file, the section number and the type. You **MUST** include in the output the most 3 to 5 most relevant reference numbers. The JSON dictionary **MUST** be in the following format:

## START OF QUERY

## END OF QUERY


From the above Query, please perform the following tasks:
    1. You **MUST** extract the most important and ultra-descriptive tags. These tags will be used to generate embeddings and then used for search purposes. You **MUST** be exhaustive and comprehensive in generating the most essential tags. Do NOT LEAVE OUT any details in the Query, and do NOT generate tags that are not in the Query. 
    2. Be **VERY** details-oriented, **make sure** you capture ALL the details of the Query in the form of tags. Do **NOT** make up or generate tags that are not in the Query. Try to reduce the number of tags, and **DO NOT** generate semantically redundant tags.
    3. The tags needs to be ultra-descriptive, elaborate and detailed. Each tag needs to capture and relay all the relationships and connections in the Query. For example, when the Query says "the actual and estimated revenues of company X", then the ideal tags would be "actual revenues of company X" and "estimated revenues of company X". For this example and instance, do **NOT** generate tags such as "actual", "estimated" and "revenues" which do not capture the full relationships and connections of the tag.
    4. Each tag needs to have enough information so that the user would understand it without knowing the original Query or the context.
    5. You **MUST** ignore any embedded Python code. 
    6. You **MUST NOT** generate tags that include example-specific information from any few-shot examples included in the Query. These are usually delimited by either ###Example###, or by ### START OF EXAMPLE and ### END OF EXAMPLE, or some similar delimiters.
    7. If the Query include entity names, dates, numbers or money amounts, you **MUST** include them in the list of tags. 
    8. Do **NOT** generate tags about Self-Evaluation Guidelines. 
    9. Finally, you **MUST** refactor the list of tags to make sure that there are no redundancies, and to remove the less relevant tags, and to reduce the number of elements in the list so that the list is optimized. 
    10. Try to reduce the number of tags to the **MOST ESSENTIAL ONES ONLY**, and minimize the overall number of tags. Only if the Query is very long, has lots details, and is absolutely needed, only then you can generate tags up to {tag_limit} tags. You **MUST** limit the total number of tags to no more than {tag_limit} tags.These **MUST BE THE MOST ESSENTIAL {tag_limit} TAGS.**

Do **NOT** generate any other text other than the comma-separated keyword and tag list. Do **NOT** exceed the number of tags to more than {tag_limit} tags.

The "analytical" category is one that does **ONLY** require analytical computations but no search. The data could **MUST** be already in the conversation history, or provided by the user query, so no search is needed, but it does rather require to run the analytical function. The analytical function can perform calculations, generate graphs and charts, and produce a variety of files including Excel sheets. For the "analytical" category, the query will look more like a follow-up ask or question.

The "search" category is one that is asking about a specific topic that will require the system to search its databases, and potentially also conduct analytical computations. The user will be asking to retrieve some values, or search some topic, or asking a question. If not enough information is provided in the User Query, or not enough information is found in the History, then "search" is the default category, and should take priority over the "analytical" category.
